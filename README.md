# Employee Management System is a python based project. I have developed the Employee Management System using python and MySql.The main module available in this project is the empassig module. which manages the functionality of salary, adding the employee information, and updating the employee information.

functions in the module--

insert_into: it takes employee information and inserts information into the table.
show_emp: it fetches all employee's information from the backend and shows in frontend.
